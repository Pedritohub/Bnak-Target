The task was to compare quarterly target with actuals from DSB bank
I had to filter from the transaction table to obtain details of only DSB bank. 
With focus on details from DSB bank, I renamed the transaction type values to either online or inperson. 
change transactuon_date to quarters
Sum the values based on transaction type and quarters. 
From the Target table, I had to pivot the table from a multiple column to single coulumn. 
From the results of the derived transaction table (cte2) and derived target table(cte3), I joined them to obtain required output.
